	description = Part of the Heisenberg line of dirigibles, we're not 100% certain that this component will meet your aerostatic lift needs, but we're pretty sure. The HL-10S is the smallest dirigible section in the 10-meter diameter HL-10 Heavy Lift series. You can also refuel from anywhere on Kerbin; price varies with distance from KSC, and you need to be landed.
