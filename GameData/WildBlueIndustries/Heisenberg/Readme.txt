Requires Hooligan Labs Airships by JewelShisen

---INSTALLATION---

Copy the contents of the mod's GameData directory into your KSP's GameData folder.
NOTE: You can find the following sub-folders in the Parts folder:

Engine: Engines used by airships.
FlightDeckSystem: The flight deck parts
Gondola: The Bison Gondola System
Structural: A custom version of the stock hollow tube.
Wheel: A custom version of the stock TR-2L.

If you're looking to cull parts, these folders will make it easier to do.

---REVISION HISTORY---

2.7.1
- Fixed NRE issues.

2.7.0 Nuclear Option

This release fulfills my initial vision for the mod; an airship with electric motors and a nuclear reactor for flying on other planets! It also makes it possible to create really big airships with huge hangar bays.

NOTE: The Cyclone no longer requires Firespitter. You will find two versions of it in the catalog. One is marked (DEPRECATED). BE SURE TO UPDATE YOUR VAB/SPH CRAFT WITH THE NEW VERSION! It's the one without (DEPRECATED) in its title. Next release the (DEPRECATED) Cyclone won't be available in the catalog, but won't break any craft in the field.

New Parts
- Half-Side Flight Deck: one side is omitted to enable the creation of large hangar decks.
- Half-Side Aircraft Elevator: one side is omitted to enable the creation of large hangar decks.
- Top-Side Flight Deck: both sides are omitted to enable the creation of large hangar decks.
- GTG-250-H: This part is a gas turbine generator that produces up to 250 EC/sec. Its output is controlled by the throttle setting. If the Buffalo mod is installed, then this part is automatically deprecated and unavailable to new vessels; there is an equivalent in the Buffalo mod.
- Nuclear Gyro Ring: Combine the current gyro ring with a nuclear reactor capable of generating 1000 EC/sec, and you have the nuclear gyro ring. Just watch out for the sticker shock.
- WB-50 "Jet Stream" Electric Prop: This Size 2 (2.5m) stack-mounted electric propeller produces huge amounts of thrust- and needs huge amounts of ElectricCharge as well.
- WB-25 "Twister" Electric Prop: This is a smaller Size 1 (1.25m) stack-mounted electric propeller.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- The HL10 Side Elevator has new mesh options: Twin Elevator Railings, Left Rail, and Right Rail. For these options, the back wall of the elevator is omitted; great for making large hangars.
- Increased power output on the Gyro Ring.
- The Cyclone no longer depends upon Firespitter. NOTE: the Firespitter version of the Cyclone is still included, but only if you have Firespitter installed. It is marked (DEPRECATED). BE SURE TO REBUILD YOUR VAB/SPH CRAFT WITH THE NEW VERSION!
- Fixed issues with forward/reverse thrust on the ducted fan.
- Fixed issues with the HL-10 Gyro Ring not producing ElectricCharge.

2.6.1
- Recompiled Kerbal Actuators.

2.6.0
- Recompiled plugin for KSP 1.3.
- Increased KIS storage in the airship hulls.
- You can convert Equipment into MaterialKits in the Workshop.
- The WB-22 "Typhoon" can be upgraded to increase thrust.
- The GTG-125 Gas Turbine Generator can be upgraded to increase ElectricCharge output.
- Updated Snacks support.

2.5.0

New Part
Cargo Gondola Type 2: This gondola component has gull-wing doors instead of slide-out doors, and it lacks a cargo ramp.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Gondola Storage Units can now participate in Pathfinder's resource distribution.
- Fixed Crash To Desktop issues experienced at startup that are associated with Kerbal Actuators.
- Revised Kerbal Actuators GUI.

2.4.2
- Gondola Storage Units now all have both internal and external KIS inventory access.
- The GondoLab and GondoHab now have 800-liters of KIS storage regardless of configuration.
- Removed experimental WBINodeStripper; it was causing KAS issues.
- Recompiled Kerbal Actuators.

2.4.1
- Minor update to consolidate RPM/ASET ModuleManager patches into one file.
- VTOL Manager has improved hover management during low framerate conditions.
- Fix for IVA screens not remembering what image they were displaying.
- GondoLab has all of its templates again.

2.4.0
New Parts
- GondoBalcony: This part is handy for preventing kerbals from opening the door on Bison office buildings, stepping outside, and experiencing a sudden stop at the end. You can toggle the central railing to extend the balcony.
- Construction Pad: Designed for the roof of a Bison module, the Construction Pad provides a landing spot for your aircraft. With ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads installed, it also doubles as a launchpad for new vessel construction.
- Pad Extension: Also designed for the roof of a Bison module, this pad extension makes your landing pads larger.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- WBT Update
- The GondoHab, GondoLab, and GondoGarden can now be broken down for easy transport and set up as office buildings, just like the GondOffice. The new ability is only available to new constructions.
- Fixed the VAB/SPH part icon for the GondOffice.
- The GondOffice's conference phone can now change the internal light color from white, blue, and off.
- Fixed IVA overlay positioning of the GondOffice.

2.3.0
New Parts
- WB-12 "Tornado": This 50kn ducted fan runs on 50 ElectricCharge per second- conveniently the same amount produced by the big solar panel... It can tilt up and down to aid in airship operations.

- S.A.F.E.R. : The Safe Affordable Fission Engine with Radiators generates ElectricCharge for your spacecraft needs. It is based upon the real-world SAFE - 400 reactor created by NASA.

- GondOffice: This alternate habitat module serves as a briefing room for your vessels- or as a transportable office space for the executive on the go. It can be disassembled into a storage box and transported by a kerbal (NOTE: there is a KIS bug where it requires several kerbals to pull an item out of storage). Once assembled, you can give it straight sidings to make it more building-like, and you can connect offices together to make a large building. If this works out, I'll modify the other bison modules (hab, lab, & greenhouse) with similar functionality.
HINT: Click the top of the conference phone to turn on/off the lights.

- GondoStairs: These external stairs give you access to the upper floors of your buildings. Just unpack them and attach them to the end of a Bison module.

Sample Craft
- Added the KV-8 Kestrel, a nuclear-powered tilt-fan aircraft. BE SURE TO WARM UP THE REACTOR BEFORE TAKING OFF!

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Added name tag to the HL-10 rudder; it is in the same place as the mission flag, and upside down relative to the mission flag.
- Updated TAC-LS greenhouse configuration for continual food production.

2.2.6
- WBT update

2.2.5
- WBT update
- Added new solar panels, available when Large Electrics is unlocked.

2.2.4
- Fixed duplicated airship hulls issue.
- Updated the Snacks converters to the latest standards.

2.2.3
- The HL-10 Command Gondola, Bison Command Cab, and Bison Airlock Module now all have an ASET-version of their cockpits. Download ASET Props 1.4 from: https://spacedock.info/mod/1204/ASET%20Props
- The HL-10 Large, Medium, and Small airship hulls can now hold a variety of different resources including LiquidFuel, ElectricCharge, and more. This only applies to new vessel construction; older vessels in-flight are unaffected.
- Minor bug fixes.
- WBT update

2.2
New Parts
- HL-10 Side Elevator: This huge 10m by 10m elevator unfolds from the side of the airship. You can then raise and lower the elevator to the hangar deck.
- Windowed Walkway: Courtesy of Enceos, this part is a crew corridor that can hold up to 3 kerbals. It currently has no IVA, but one might be included in a future release.

Wide Width
The Flight Deck System parts (Flight Deck, Flight Deck Fairing, Aircraft Elevator, Side Elevator) now have the ability to toggle their meshes between Standard Width and Wide Width. Wide width changes the models so that their sides are perpendicular to the hangar deck, giving you the full 10-meter width to store your vehicles. In Wide width mode, there's just enough room to store a stock Aeris 3A in the hangar.

Sample Craft
Found in the Heisenberg/SampleCraft folder are 3 sample airships and one support plane:
- Heisenberg (SPH): made entirely from the parts pack and stock parts, she has two first-class cabins, two passenger cabins, and can carry cargo as well.
- Macon (SPH): a modified Heisenberg-class airship, the Macon has been turned into a flying aircraft carrier. Macon has a wider hangar deck than her sister ship, the Akron.
- Skydancer (VAB): This airship is equipped with rocket booster to achieve orbit. She has an array of science equipment on her back, two hab modules, to science labs, a pair of greenhouses, and a power pack of Nerve engines. Just launch Skydancer into orbit, refuel her, and fly the airship to Laythe.
- Aeris 3V (SPH): This is a highly modified Aeris 3A that's equipped with VTOL engines and an underbelly docking port. It's a nice complement to the Macon.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed sound effects issue with the cargo lift.
- You can now select the default image for the Plasma Screen in addition to screens in the Screenshots folder.
- Moved the kPad and plasma screens to the Utility tab.

2.1.6
- Updated crash tolerances for the Flight Deck System (FDS) parts.
- FDS Type 1 and Type 2 extension parts now have symmetry enabled.
- The GondoLab's Geology Lab can participate in Pathfinder's Gold Strike mini-game.
- The GondoDrill can convert Gold Strike resource lode resources from Ore.

2.1.5
- Added Bison to Buffalo adapters. There are two types.
- Removed velocity modifying code from the ground stabilizer. Be warned, your vessels might slip on slopes.
- Moved Flight Deck Extensions to Advanced Aerodynamics.
- The Gyro Ring now correctly takes in Atmosphere and creates CompressedAir.
- Fixed issues with KerbNet in the command pods.
- Simplified the production chain for TAC-LS to use Waste in place of Fertilizer.
- Added a Compost Lab configuration to GondoLab to make Fertilizer when Snacks is installed.

2.1.0

New Parts

- Storage Gondola: You now have a 2u and a 1u storage gondola.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- All configs in the Spaces folder have been moved to their appropriate folder under Parts. Now it's even easier to remove what you don't use.
- IVAs are showing properly again.

2.0.4
- Annnd fixed the issue with the cyclone engines...

2.0.3
- Renamed the Airships folder to the Heisenberg folder to avoid installation conflicts with Hooligan Labs
IMPORTANT NOTE: You'll need to re-install Hooligan Labs and Heisenberg, sorry about that..
- Fixed converter names so that the monopropellant converter says that it converts Ore into MonoPropellant, and so on..

2.0 Kerbin Exploration Initiative
At last, the dream is alive! Named in honor of and inspired by EJ_SA's K.E.I. mission, this release completes the parts pack for the Heisenberg airship. Now you can build airships, flying aircraft carriers, and even large rovers! Special thank you to Shnyrik for allowing me to use his flying aircraft carrier screen shots. :)

New Parts: Flight Deck System
- HL-10 Hangar Deck: The Hangar Deck has space for 4 kerbals and it has doors that can be retracted. Its cavernous bay can easily hold a stock FL-14400 fuel tank with room to spare. Flip the part upside down and you have a drop bay. The Hangar Deck forms the cornerstone of the Heisenberg Flight Deck System. When building an airship, simply open the doors and attach the flight deck components on top of the part. Finally, it has a name tag that you can change.
TIP: Docking ports work great for attaching aircraft and rovers to the hangar deck.
- Hangar Bay Hard Top: When attached to the Hangar Deck, the Hard Top provides a seamless look for your airships.
- HL-10 Flight Deck: When attached to the Hangar Deck, it provides a place for your aircraft to land. It has a large name tag on the top that you can change. Finally, it holds a variety of different resources.
- HL-10 Elevator Deck: Also attached to the Hangar Deck, it has a large elevator to lower your aircraft to the hangar deck or raise them up to the flight deck. You cannot attach parts to the elevator itself, but you can attach parts to the sides and edges of the part.
NOTE: The Hangar Deck crew hatches WILL BE OBSTRUCTED when the elevator is lowered.
- Flight Deck Extensions: The extensions let you build the flight deck over other parts of the hull. The Type 1 and Type 2 Extensions have a large name tag on the top that you can change, and the Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 extensions let you switch between deck markings and no deck markings.
NOTE: The attachment nodes on the extensions are oriented vertically BY DESIGN to ensure that the flight decks properly attach to the hangar deck.
- Flight Deck Fairing: This part helps close the gaps between your flight decks and airship hulls.
TIP: You can attach an extension onto the deck fairing. The attachment node is at the back.
- Cargo Lift: You can use this part to lower cargo and small vehicles from the hangar deck to the ground. Like the aircraft elevator, the Cargo Lift cannot have parts attached to it. The Cargo Lift's speed can be varied (25% is good for lowering kerbals to the ground), and its maximum cable length is 200 meters.
NOTE: The cargo lift isn't perfect and might not align with the hangar deck perfectly. Use the fine controls to tweak the height after it raises back up to the ship.
NOTE: Be sure to place your cargo within the red box outline on the lift. Bad things will happen if you don't.
NOTE: BY DESIGN, the cargo lift doesn't remember if it was up or down when you leave the scene. I don't trust KSP to set things up properly upon your return...

New Parts: Bison Gondola System
- HL-10 Command Gondola*: It holds a crew of 4 and has excellent visibility. It can be upgraded to not require crew to operate.
- Passenger Gondola*: It holds 16 crew.
- GondoHab*: It holds 4 crew, but it ties into life support Mods (Snacks, TAC-LS, USI-LS). And yes, that is an aluminium piano on the lower deck. GondoHab can use Pathfinder's Habitation templates.
- GondoLab*: It too holds 4 crew, and it has many configurations including a Mobile Processing Lab. It can also use Pathfinder's Science templates.
- GondoGarden*: It holds 4 crew and functions as a greenhouse when a life support mod is installed.
- Storage Gondola*: It can hold a variety of different resources.
- Cargo Gondola*: It has doors that slide open and a ramp that extends to the ground.
- GondoDrill: This early model drill is expensive but it lets you extract resources.
- Bison Command Cab*: Use it to turn your gondola parts into a rover system, or use it as a cupola to watch the world go by.
- Bison Jump Jet Module: It has reaction wheels, a vertically oriented probe core for VTOL operations, RCS, and a pair of jump jets.
- Bison Airlock Module* (BAM): Designed to fit on the back of your rover, it provides you with a way to exit the vehicle without depressurizing one of your cabins. If you have Extraplanetary Launchpads installed, then the BAM doubles as a survey station. It can even serve as a command pod if needed.
- Bison Stabilizer Legs: These legs help stabilize gondolas while on the ground.
NOTE: Stabilizer might slip on slopes. I'm still working on this...
- Bison Docking Port: This port is specially designed to dock gondola parts together.
NOTE: If you want to create long trains, try using the stock asteroid grabber unit in free pivot mode. A custom part is in the works.
- Bison Fairings: There are several types to choose from.
* Can be surface-attached.

New Parts: Accessories
- HL-10 RCS Module: It runs on CompressedAir, which you can create by running the Cyclone engine or by using a Gyro Ring.
- Mk1 ISRU Module: It takes up 2/3 of the Storage Gondola, and its resource production is limited at first, but it gets better as you unlock more tech nodes.
- Search Radar: It is functionally equivalent to the stock M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner. It's avaiable earlier, but it is larger, heavier, and more expensive.
- Buckboard 6000: It's twice the size and twice the capacity of the Buckboard 3000.
- TR-2S: It's a customized stock TR-2L that's more expensive but available earlier. This is an interim solution, a custom wheel is in the works.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Increased torque values on the Gyro Ring. The airship should be better able to stay upright and maneuver now.
- The Gyro Ring can now create ElectricCharge by burning IntakeAir and LiquidFuel, and it can create CompressedAir via Atmosphere and ElectricCharge.
- Added CompressedAir storage to the Gyro Ring and the Cyclone engine.
- For new airships, the name tags are turned off by default.
- Added flags to the HL-10L and HL-10M hulls. By default they're hidden.
- Added Module Manager & Wild Blue Tools.
- Added a custom category icon for the Heisenberg.
- Removed the WBIGasStation part module; the ISRU parts now fill its role.
- Airship hulls are better able to withstand the heat of the rocket fuel that they're painted with.

1.1.5
- Removed ModuleManager dependency.
- Moved name tag decals on the HL-10L and HL-10M to the lower part of the hull.

1.1
