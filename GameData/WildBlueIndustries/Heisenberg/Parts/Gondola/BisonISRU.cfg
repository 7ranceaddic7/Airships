	description = This prototype In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) module is designed to fit in the cargo gondola as well as the Buffalo' wide flatbeds. It can take raw materials from convert them into useful products, albeit not very efficiently. These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating. Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat. Its capabilities improve with technological advancement.
