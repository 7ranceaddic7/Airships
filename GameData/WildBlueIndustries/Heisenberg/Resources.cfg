// Skythane: A commercial blend of gasses that offers low to moderate flammability, reduced ignition risk, good gas stability and moderate cost compared to other lifting gasses.
// It can be created by combining Propellium (1 unit) and Zeonium (9 units) Classic Stock Resources, or Hydrogen (5 units) and Helium (40 units) for Community Resource Pack resources.
// For the curious, though we'll never officially state this in game, Skythane is a mixture of 60% Helium and 40% hydrogen by mass.

// Liquified Cryogenic Skythane
// Higher density for transport.
// 1 unit of liquified Skythane will yield 722.39 units of gas-form Skythane.
// You'd need very little electric charge to do that- just let it boil.
// Compressing 722.39 units of gaseous Skythane to 1 unit of liquified Skythane takes 9.5 EC/sec
